Step 1: Grate Your Cheese

Step 2: Fill the big pot with water and throw in a couple of generous pinches of salt. Bring this to a boil.

Step 3: As soon as the water comes to a boil, dump your pasta in. You need to cook the pasta so that it is slightly underdone. You want it to still be able to accept some liquid so that it'll soak up the cream later.

Step 4: Put the 6 tbs. of butter into the saute pan over medium/low heat and start it melting while the pasta cooks. As soon as it's melted, turn off the heat. You don't want the butter to brown.

Step 5: When the pasta is done cooking, drain it 

Step 6: When the pasta is draining, reheat the butter. You'll want the heat to be medium high. 

Step 7: Now, turn the pasta into the pan and pour the cream over top. You'll fold this mixture together for a few minutes until the pasta soaks up nearly all of the cream.

Step 8: Then, add the cheese and fold again. It'll take a little elbow grease to get it all combined.

Step 9: Once it's combined, taste test and add pepper and salt as desired.

Step 10: Enjoy your pasta. :D
And maybe invite some friends or family over to help you finish it off?
